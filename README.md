# Aggressive Action Detection Model

Our project is to develop an autonomous active surveillance system that detects aggressive actions, such as human holding weapons, particularly knives and machetes. The detection is powered by our proposed HOI model, meticulously crafted upon the robust RT-DETR model architecture. We also developed a dashboard to enable live video streaming for real-time detection as well as displaying the model prediction results.
